## Rabies data from Pemba

[rabies\_cases\_anonymized.csv](src/assets/data/rabies_cases_anonymized.csv)
are 202 suspected rabid animal cases on Pemba Island, Tanzania between
2010-01-05 - 2018-10-27. The case-infector links have been reconstructed
using methods described in [Hampson et
al.Â 2009](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1000053).

### Metadata for columns

| Column              | Description                                                                                                                                   |
|:--------------------|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| id\_case            | The unique id of the case.                                                                                                                    |
| id\_progen\_tree    | The unique id of the infector identified through a combination of contact tracing and transmission tree reconstruction.                       |
| id\_progen\_tracing | The unique id of the infector for a subset of animals for which contact tracing data is available.                                            |
| lineage\_chain      | The phylogenetic lineage which the case belongs to identified through transmission tree reconstruction. All cases will have a non-zero value. |
| lineage\_case       | The phylogenetic lineage assigned to a sampled case, if zero that means this case was unsampled.                                              |
| utm\_easting        | The x-coordinate location (in UTM coordinates) randomly jittered by 500 - 1000 meters to preserve anonymity.                                  |
| utm\_northing       | The y-coordinate location (in UTM coordinates) randomly jittered by 500 - 1000 meters to preserve anonymity.                                  |
| species             | The species of animal.                                                                                                                        |
| date\_symptoms      | The date at which the animal began showing symptoms.                                                                                          |

All case locations have been anonymized spatially. Please contact the
